The calibTables/static Subdirectory

This subdirectory contains a collection of calibration update files that
are very nearly static, and which should be version controlled.  An example
of a mostly static table is the mapping of the physical wire to the
geometry identification.

The files in this directory will be used to update the database before the
tables downloaded from the distribution site.  They should NOT be
compressed since the software repository will take care of the
compression.

There should be a "dummy" for most tables that is pre-dated to before we
started taking data.  This will handle the case when there isn't a
calibration available.
